V1_BWAtoTranscriptome, V1_RNASeqQuantification: UNC V1 RNA-Seq Workflow - BWA Alignment to Transcriptome

Date: 20101108

Authors:

* Sara Grimm <sacheek@med.unc.edu>
* Brian O'Connor <brianoc@email.unc.edu>

Versions:

This analysis was carried out using the SeqWare Pipeline project, version
0.7.0. The workflow was "RNASeqAlignmentBWA" version 0.7.x. UNC
provides all our analysis software through this open source project. Users can
download this software to run the identical RNA-Seq analysis described in the
steps below. See the project website at http://seqware.sf.net for more
information. The UNCIDs provided in file names are identifiers unique to UNC
and can be used to provide data/analysis provenance tracking.

Annotations:

The Generic Annotation File (GAF) that provides all of our annotations for
genes, exons, etc can be found at
https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcgafiles/ftp_auth/distro_ftpusers/anonymous/other/GAF/GAF_bundle/outputs/TCGA.Sept2010.09202010.gaf

Conventions:

Please note our spljxn.quantification.txt, exon.quantification.txt, and the
GAF file above use the convention of chr:smaller_int-larger_int:+ for plus
strand features and chr:larger_int-smaller_int:- for negative strand features.
Carefully examine future versions of these annotation and quantification files
since this convension is subject to change.

Column Headers:

These are just brief descriptions of the column headers you will find in the
various level 3 files. See the DESCRIPTION.txt file in the mage-tab bunlde for
more detailed methods on how each of these files were created.

File: *.trimmed.annotated.gene.quantification.txt

* gene: This is the Entrez/LocusLink gene symbol followed by the
  Entrez/LocusLink gene ID.
* raw_counts: The number of reads mapping to this gene.
* median_length_normalized: This is the total aligned bases to all transcript
  models associated with this gene divided by the mean transcript length.
* RPKM: See the DESCRIPTION.txt file in the mage-tab bunlde for
  information on how this is calculated.

File: *.trimmed.annotated.exon.quantification.txt

* exon: This is the location of the exon in hg19 (GRCh37) based on the UCSC
  Gene standard track (December 2009 version).
* raw_counts: The number of reads mapping to this exon.
* median_length_normalized: This is the total aligned bases to this exon
  divided by the exon length.
* RPKM: See the DESCRIPTION.txt file in the mage-tab bunlde for
  information on how this is calculated.

File: *.trimmed.annotated.spljxn.quantification.txt

This file does not include normalized counts since splice junctions are a
fixed size.

* junction: This is the location of the splice junction in hg19 (GRCh37)
  based on the UCSC Gene standard track (December 2009 version).
* raw_counts: The number of reads mapping to this splice junction.

File: *.wig

This is a WIG file format that represents coverage, see

V2_MapSpliceRSEM: UNC V2 RNA-Seq Workflow - MapSplice genome alignment and RSEM estimation of GAF 2.1

Date: 05-10-2012

Contacts:

* Lisle Mose <lmose@email.unc.edu>
* Joel Parker <parkerjs@email.unc.edu>

Versions:

This analysis was carried out using the SeqWare Pipeline project, version
0.7.0. The workflow was "MapspliceRSEM" version 0.7.x. UNC
provides all our analysis software through this open source project. 

Annotations:

The Generic Annotation File (GAF) that provides all of our annotations for
genes, exons, etc can be found at
https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/GAF/GAF.hg19.June2011.bundle/outputs/TCGA.hg19.June2011.gaf

Conventions:

Please note our junction_quantification.txt, exon_quantification.txt, and the
GAF file above use the convention of chr:smaller_int-larger_int:+ for plus
strand features and chr:larger_int-smaller_int:- for negative strand features.
Carefully examine future versions of these annotation and quantification files
since this convension is subject to change.

Column Headers:

RSEM abundance estimation results in two files, gene and isoform level quantification. More
information regarding the content of these output files can be found on the RSEM website
(http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/rsem/rsem-calculate-expression.html#output).  In short,
the format indicates the feature name in column 1, esimated count in colum 2, scaled
estimate in column 3, and contributing isoforms in column 4 (gene level only). These files
will have the following extensions:

rsem.genes.results
rsem.isoforms.results

RSEM expression estimates are normalized to set the upper quartile count at 1000 for gene level
and 300 for isoform level estimates.  These files have two columns, feature name and normalized
count, and correspond to the following extensions:
 
rsem.genes.normalized_results
rsem.isoforms.normalized_results

Exon and junction level quantification are provided in a similar format as described for V1, although
the Mapsplice genome alignments are used for overlap counting in V2.  The exon counts are formatted as
exon location in column 1(hg19 based on the UCSC Gene standard track, December 2009 version), number of
reads in column 2, fraction of bases covered in column 3, and RPKM (calculated as described for V1) in 
column 4. The exon count files have the extension:

bt.exon_quantification.txt

The file format for junction counts is identical to V1 and has the extension:

junction_quantification.txt
